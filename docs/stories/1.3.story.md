# Story 1.3: Gestão de Usuários (Promotoras)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to manage promotora users with complete CRUD operations including creation, viewing, editing, and deletion,
**so that** I can control user access to the system and assign promotoras to their respective stores.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Admin can view a list of all users with their assigned stores and roles
3. Admin can edit existing user information and store assignments
4. Admin can delete users (with appropriate warnings if user has transaction history)
5. Email must be unique and follow validation rules (valid email format)
6. User operations must respect RLS policies (admin-only access)
7. UI must follow responsive design principles and NFR1 localization (es-CO)
8. User list must show active/inactive status and last login information
9. User operations must have proper error handling and user feedback
10. All forms must include proper validation and accessibility features
11. Integration with Supabase Auth for user authentication management

- Form validation patterns established with React Hook Form + Zod
- Spanish localization (es-CO) patterns implemented throughout
- Testing infrastructure operational (Vitest + MCP Playwright)
- Toast notification system configured for user feedback

### NFR Compliance
**NFR1 - Localization es-CO (CRITICAL):** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#localização-e-internacionalização]
- HTML `lang="es-CO"` mandatory in all pages
- Spanish Colombian interface text required
- DD/MM/YYYY date format with `Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-CO')`
- Timezone America/Bogota for all timestamps
- Font configuration must include latin-ext subset

**NFR3 - Role-Based Access Control:** [Source: prd/2-requisitos.md#não-funcionais]
- Promotora users restricted to their assigned store only
- Admin users have full system access
- Access control enforced at database level via RLS

### UX Principles
**Mobile-First Design:** [Source: ui_ux/1-introducao-e-principios-de-ux.md#principios-de-design]
- Admin interface optimized for desktop with information density
- Task-oriented design for efficient user management
- Immediate visual feedback for all user actions
- Clear action hierarchy for CRUD operations

**Layout Specifications:** [Source: ui_ux/4-wireframes-e-mockups.md#layout-do-administrador]
- Admin: Navigation lateral fixa à esquerda (fixed left sidebar)
- Tables for user management with responsive card fallback
- Form dialogs for create/edit operations

### Design System
**Component Library:** [Source: ui_ux/5-biblioteca-de-componentes-design-system.md]
- **shadcn/ui**: Base components mandatory for all interfaces
- **Magic UI**: Admin-only with lazy loading (BorderBeam for elegant borders)
- **PROHIBITED**: Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Bootstrap

**Theme System:** [Source: ui_ux/5-biblioteca-de-componentes-design-system.md#sistema-de-tema]
```css
--falabella-red: #E31837
--falabella-dark-red: #B91C3C
--falabella-gray: #64748B
--falabella-light-gray: #F8FAFC
```

### Data Models
**profiles table schema:** [Source: supabase/migrations/20250820003311_create_profiles_table.sql]
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'promotora')),
  store_id UUID REFERENCES stores(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Auth Integration:** [Source: architecture/4-modelos-de-dados.md]
- Profiles table linked to Supabase auth.users via id foreign key
- Email stored in both auth.users and profiles for query efficiency
- Role determines access level (admin vs promotora)
- store_id links promotora to specific store (NULL for admin)

### API Specifications
**Data Access:** [Source: architecture/5-especificacao-da-api.md]
- Communication via Supabase JavaScript client library
- Auth operations via supabase.auth.admin API
- Profile operations via supabase.from('profiles')
- RLS policies enforce admin-only access at database level

**Auth Operations:**
```typescript
// User creation
supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: string,
  password: string,
  email_confirm: true
})

// User deletion
supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(userId)

// Password reset
supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email)
```
