--falabella-dark-red: #B91C3C
--falabella-gray: #64748B
--falabella-light-gray: #F8FAFC
```

### Data Models
**products table schema:** [Source: architecture/4-modelos-de-dados.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  sku_parent TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  brand TEXT NOT NULL,
  style TEXT NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  cost DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**variants table schema:** [Source: architecture/4-modelos-de-dados.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE variants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sku_child TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  size TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Parent-Child Relationship:** [Source: architecture/4-modelos-de-dados.md]
- products.id → variants.product_id (FK with CASCADE DELETE)
- SKU hierarchy: sku_parent (products) → sku_child (variants)
- Inventory tracking via variants table connection to inventory table

### API Specifications
**Data Access:** [Source: architecture/5-especificacao-da-api.md]
- Communication via Supabase JavaScript client library
- Product operations via supabase.from('products')
- Variant operations via supabase.from('variants')
- RLS policies enforce admin-only access at database level

**Product Operations:**
```typescript
// Product creation
supabase.from('products').insert({
  sku_parent: string,
  brand: string,
  style: string,
  price: number,
  cost: number
})

// Variant creation
supabase.from('variants').insert({
  product_id: UUID,
  sku_child: string,
  size: string
})

// Product with variants query
supabase.from('products')
  .select(`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with comprehensive CRUD functionality for product management. The code demonstrates strong adherence to project standards with proper TypeScript typing, Spanish localization throughout, and clean architecture separation. All acceptance criteria have been thoroughly implemented with robust error handling and user feedback.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/__tests__/products/product-table.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed test assertions to handle both desktop and mobile view rendering
  - **Why**: The ProductTable component renders elements in both desktop and mobile views, causing duplicate elements that broke test assertions
  - **How**: Updated tests to use `getAllByText()` and verify expected length for elements that appear in both views

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with TypeScript strict mode, Next.js patterns, and Spanish localization
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect adherence to monorepo structure and component organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit tests, component tests, and validation tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 11 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed test suite to properly handle responsive design dual-rendering (product-table.test.tsx)
- [x] Verified Colombian Peso currency formatting throughout all components
- [x] Confirmed Spanish localization in all user-facing text
- [x] Validated parent-child product relationship with cascade deletion
- [x] Checked admin-only access control with RLS policies
- [x] Verified SKU uniqueness validation for both parent and child SKUs
- [x] Confirmed responsive design with desktop table and mobile card views

### Security Review

Strong security implementation with proper RLS policies enforcing admin-only access. All user inputs are validated with Zod schemas, and SKU uniqueness is properly checked to prevent duplicates. No security vulnerabilities identified.

### Performance Considerations

Efficient implementation using TanStack Query for data caching (5-minute cache) and proper React patterns. Component renders are optimized with proper key usage and minimal re-renders. Currency formatting uses native Intl.NumberFormat for optimal performance.

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/web/__tests__/products/product-table.test.tsx` - Fixed test assertions for responsive rendering

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-gestao-de-produtos-catalogo.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All requirements met, tests passing, no blocking issues identified
