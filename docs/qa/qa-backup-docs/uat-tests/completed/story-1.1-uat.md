    result: ✅ Page loaded successfully
    
  2_snapshot:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
    result: ✅ Home page structure captured
    evidence: "Shows Next.js welcome with login button"
```

### Test 2: Validate Authentication Flow Foundation
```yaml
test: "Admin user can login and access admin dashboard"
steps:
  1_navigate_to_login:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
    url: "http://localhost:3000/login"
    result: ✅ Login page accessible
    
  2_enter_credentials:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_type
    element: "Email input field"
    ref: "input[name='email']"
    text: "admin@example.com"
    result: ✅ Email entered
    
  3_enter_password:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_type
    element: "Password input field"
    ref: "input[name='password']"
    text: "password123"
    result: ✅ Password entered
    
  4_submit_form:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_click
    element: "Sign in button"
    ref: "button[type='submit']"
    result: ✅ Form submitted
    
  5_wait_for_redirect:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for
    text: "Admin Dashboard"
    result: ✅ Successfully redirected to admin area
    
  6_verify_role_access:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
    result: ✅ Admin dashboard displays correctly
    evidence: "Admin-specific navigation and content visible"
```

### Test 3: Validate Promotora Role Access
```yaml
test: "Promotora user has restricted access"
steps:
  1_logout_admin:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_click
    element: "Sign out button"
    ref: "button:has-text('Sign Out')"
    result: ✅ Admin logged out
    
  2_login_promotora:
    sequence: [navigate, type email, type password, submit]
    credentials: "promotora@example.com"
    result: ✅ Promotora logged in
    
  3_verify_redirect:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for
    text: "Promotora Dashboard"
    result: ✅ Redirected to promotora area
    
  4_verify_restrictions:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
    url: "http://localhost:3000/admin"
    result: ✅ Access denied - redirected to promotora area
    evidence: "Role-based routing working correctly"
```

### Test 4: Validate Database Connection
```yaml
test: "Application connects to Supabase successfully"
steps:
  1_check_console:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
    result: ✅ No connection errors in console
    
  2_verify_data_fetch:
    tool: mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate
    function: "() => window.fetch('/api/health').then(r => r.json())"
    result: ✅ API responds with healthy status
```
